I investigated using computer vision to identify American football formations and plays.

The big picture goal was to provide a means to glean game critical data without manual labour.
THe goal was to determine the field lines and identify the Line of Scrimmage, offensive and defensive players 
and then output the data in a means that the end user can begin critical analysis of the data.

The algorithms for the 
Field Lines/ LOS Detection  was the
Probabilistic Hough (HUFF) Line Transforms, canny Edge filtering, Gaussian blur and grayscaling of the image.

The algorithms for the player Detection used
Colour Thresholding.
L*a*b* colour space conversion.
Morphology
Adaptive thresholding.
Contouring.

Improved line detection meant line detection could occur throughout a play clip.
First frame identification of Line of scrimmage correct.
Players could be detected but! requires improvement to create meaningful statistics from such detections. 
Field logo and NFL logo watermark were removed from detection
Didnt have trained data to map output to specific formations/plays which would lead to creating datasets for analysis.
And unable to utilise pytesseract to detect field numbers to create relative position in output.

Yellow lines are the field markers and the line of scrimmage in the white.

Here outputted.
